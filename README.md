The project focuses on data wrangling, entity resolution, and data preparation tasks using various datasets. It involves performing detailed profiling of relational data, comparing and cleaning data using techniques like Levenshtein, Jaro, and affine similarities for attributes such as titles, authors, venues, and years. The project also implements a method for identifying duplicate records based on similarity scores, evaluates precision, and discusses approaches to reduce computational time. Additionally, the data preparation phase involves handling missing or disguised values in a diabetes dataset, calculating correlations between variables, and replacing missing values with mean values based on class labels. The overall goal is to prepare, clean, and analyze data for accurate and efficient results.
